== Welcome to GroovyContent

Current version: pre 0.1 - script is still being tested in development and production environment.

GroovyContent is simple site managing applications (simple CMS?) that allow you to:
- manage multiple sites
- create multiple page types and / or collections and create for them custom attributes
- insert rich content into your pages (wysiwyg editor with file manager support)
- manage inquiry forms (and create custom field types)
- edit template files without any need to use any kind of external editor and/or file transfer protocol
- use templating language (no worry, that you, your designer or client himself will fu... break something by using Ruby in templates)


== TODO

There is still lots of things, that need to be done:
- file manager 
- lots of UI fixes
- complete documentation and how-tos
- tests
