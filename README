== Welcome to GroovyContent

GroovyContent is simple site managing applications (simple CMS?) that allow you to:
- manage multiple sites
- create multiple page types and / or collections and create for them custom attributes
- insert rich content into your pages (wysiwyg editor with file manager support)
- manage inquiry forms (and create custom field types)
- edit template files without any need to use any kind of external editor and/or file transfer protocol
- use templating language (no worry, that you, your designer or client himself will fu... break something by using Ruby in templates)
